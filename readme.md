# My first project using node/express.js

There's nothing much to it than just to server bunch of static files to the server.

# Requirement

- Clone this repo into your preferred folder on your computer.
- Make sure to have _node.js_ installed on your computer and if not, install _node.js_ so you can have access to npm.
- Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run `npm install` to install the packages required to run the project on your computer.
- Then run `npm start` to run the _nodemon_ package that watches the server and restart on changes.
- Open your favorite browser and enter the url of _http://localhost:5000_ and you should see the web page.
